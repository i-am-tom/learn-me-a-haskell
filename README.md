# Learning Me a Haskell ðŸŽ©âœ¨

It's about time I figured out what all the fuss is about. I'll keep all my
findings in this repo.

Although this repo mainly exists for my benefit, I've tried to document
*everything* thoroughly, so I hope it's useful to others. If you have any
questions or suggestions on how to improve the docs, please [send me a
tweet](https://www.twitter.com/am_i_tom) or a PR and we'll improve things :)

## Setup

```bash
$ # Build the project with haddocks
$ stack build --haddock --fast

$ # Install the `doctest` tool
$ cabal install doctest

$ # Run the tests - they're in the docs!
$ doctest src
```

## [OneOf](/src/OneOf/Types.hs#L38-L40)

### Intro

`OneOf` is a generalised version of `Either` (I think sometimes known as a
`Variant`?). While `Either` is strictly for one of two possibilities, `OneOf`
generalises this to any (non-zero) number of possibilities with a type-level
list. For example:

```haskell
f :: OneOf '[String]            -- `String`
g :: OneOf '[String, Bool]      -- `Either String Bool`
h :: OneOf '[String, Bool, Int] -- `Either String (Either Bool Int)`
```

Rather than using `Left` and `Right`, we construct these values with some
number of `There`s followed by a `Here`. For example:

```haskell
f :: OneOf '[String]
f = Here "Hello!"

g :: OneOf '[String, Bool]
g = There (Here True)

h :: OneOf '[String, Bool, Int]
h = There (There (Here 3))
```

### Injection

The above is quite... ugly, though, right? What we'd really like is a neat way
to "lift" a type into the `OneOf` without having to worry about the number of
`There`s we need. Luckily, the `inject` function gives us just that:

```haskell
f :: OneOf '[String]
f = inject "Hello"

g :: OneOf '[String, Bool]
g = inject True

h :: OneOf '[String, Bool, Integer]
h = inject 3
```

`inject` looks through the list for the first occurrence of our type, and
produces the constructors required to lift our value into the `OneOf`.

### Projection

Cool, we have a type that could hold a value that is one of any number of
types... how do we _use_ it? Well, we could pattern-match, but then we're back
to worrying about everything `Here` and `There`. To help with this, the `fold`
function will generate a Church-style fold for any `OneOf` value:

```haskell
f :: OneOf '[String]
  -> (String -> result)
  -> result
f = fold

g :: OneOf '[String, Bool]
  -> (String -> result)
  -> (Bool   -> result)
  -> result
g = fold

h :: OneOf '[String, Bool, Int]
  -> (String -> result)
  -> (Bool   -> result)
  -> (Int    -> result)
  -> result
h = fold
```

The type is calculated based on the type of the `OneOf` supplied as a first
argument, and the pattern is always the same: _give me a function from each
type to some `r`, and I'll just call the appropriate one._

Alternatively, we can fold a `OneOf` using a constraint, assuming that all
values have an instance:

```haskell
h :: OneOf '[String, Bool, Int] -> String
h = interpret @Show show
```

Here, we use the fact that `String`, `Bool`, and `Int` all have `Show`
instances, and thus have an instance for the `show` function that returns a
`String`. Now, we'll just get the `show` result for whatever is in our value.

## [HList](/src/HList/Types.hs#L43-L45)

### Intro

`HList` is a generalised version of `Tuple` which allows you to carry lists of
values with *possibly-different* types. It's notionally equivalent to tuples:

| Tuple              | HList                 |
| ------------------:|:--------------------- |
| `()`               | `HList '[]`           |
| `(a)`              | `HList '[a]`          |
| `(a, b)`           | `HList '[a, b]`       |
| `(a, (b, c))`      | `HList '[a, b, c]`    |
| `(a, (b, (c, d)))` | `HList '[a, b, c, d]` |

_Of course, `(a)` is just `a` - a one-element tuple _is_ its type._ The H in
`HList` stands for *heterogenous*, as distinct from a _homogeneous_ list where
all elements must be the same type. Similarly to a list, we construct them with
cons and nil constructors, imaginatively named `HCons` and `HNil`:

```haskell
f :: HList '[]
f = HNil

g :: HList '[Bool]
g = HCons True HNil

h :: HList '[String, Bool]
h = HCons "hello" (HCons True HNil)

-- etc.
```

### Construction

As we noted with `OneOf`, this is still rather ugly, and we can use some
type-level trickery to tidy this up. `build` is a function that builds an HList
by taking all its values as parameters in the order they appear (using a
healthy dose of typeclass magic).

```haskell
f :: HList '[]
f = build

g :: Int -> HList '[Int]
g = build

h :: String -> Int -> HList '[String, Int]
h = build
```

_This involves some fun tricks behind the scenes that I've documented in [the
`HList.build` file](src/HList/Build.hs)._

## Updating

Now we have our glorious `HList`, can we change the values â€“ or even _types_ â€“
within it? You bet!

The `update` function takes a function and an `HList`, and applies that
function to an index that we specify with a *type application*. For example:

```haskell
xs :: HList '[Integer, Double, Bool]
xs = HCons 2 (HCons 2.0 (HCons True HNil))

-- HCons 2 (HCons 2.0 (HCons False (HNil)))
f = update @2 not xs

-- HCons 2 (HCons "hello" (HCons True (HNil)))
g = update @1 (\_ -> "hello") xs

-- ... â€¢ 4 is out of bounds for '[Integer, Double, Bool]!
-- ...   We'll need at least 0, and at most 2.
h = update @4 show xs

-- â€¢ You can't apply [Char] -> [Char] to the Double at index #1.
--   I'm sorry, captain; I just won't do it.
i = update @1 (++ "!") xs -- Type mismatch!
```

We can see here that our index is updated when the types align, and we
otherwise get some nice custom type errors! _I'd like to add more type errors
here, but I'm at the stage where I have to wrestle a bit with incoherence)_.

## Projection

We have an `HList`, and we can pattern-match as we want, but... can we _fold_
an `HList`? Well, similarly to `OneOf`, we can have a constrained fold:

```haskell
fold
  :: Monoid monoid
  => (forall element. constraint element => element -> monoid)
  -> HList list
  -> monoid
```

If all our `element`s satisfy some `constraint`, we can use this `fold` method
to combine them all under some monoid. For example, `fold @Show show` will take
the string representation of every element of any `HList` and concat the
results together, as long as all the types have a `Show` instance.

Another fun consequence of this generalisation is that we can recover
homogeneous operations like `foldMap` by using a constraint like `((~)
element)` (every element of the list must be equal to some type `element`). In
fact, that's exactly how `foldMap` is implemented within this library!
