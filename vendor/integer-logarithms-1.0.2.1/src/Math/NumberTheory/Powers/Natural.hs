-- | Power of an 'Natural' by the left-to-right repeated squaring algorithm.
--   This needs two multiplications in each step while the right-to-left
--   algorithm needs only one multiplication for 0-bits, but here the
--   two factors always have approximately the same size, which on average
--   gains a bit when the result is large.
--
--   For small results, it is unlikely to be any faster than '(^)', quite
--   possibly slower (though the difference shouldn't be large), and for
--   exponents with few bits set, the same holds. But for exponents with
--   many bits set, the speedup can be significant.
--
--   /Warning:/ No check for the negativity of the exponent is performed,
--   a negative exponent is interpreted as a large positive exponent.
